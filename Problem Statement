# Brewers Research & Development – Coding Solutions (2025–2026)

## Overview

This repository contains my analytical and computational solutions to selected quantitative problems from the Milwaukee Brewers Research & Development Questionnaire (2025–2026).

The goal of these problems is to evaluate probabilistic reasoning, simulation design, decision modeling, and expected-value analysis within realistic baseball and operational contexts.

All solutions are implemented in Python using a combination of:

- State-space modeling
- Dynamic programming
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Expected value analysis
- Probability modeling

## Problem Statements & Requirements

Below is a structured summary of the core analytical challenges addressed in this repository.

---

### Problem 1 – Walk-Off Probability Modeling

**Objective**

Determine the value of a parameter \( p \) such that a team trailing by two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning has exactly a 20% probability of walking off and winning the game.

**Given**

- A fixed batting order (1–9).
- Known outcome probabilities (Strikeout, Single, Home Run).
- For batters 4 and 5, probabilities depend on parameter \( p \).
- Singles advance all runners exactly two bases.
- No other advancement rules apply.
- The inning ends at three outs.
- The game ends immediately upon scoring the winning run.

**Requirements**

- Model the inning as a probabilistic state-transition system.
- Track outs, base occupancy, batting order, and runs scored.
- Compute win probability as a function of \( p \).
- Solve for the value of \( p \) that yields a 20% walk-off probability.

This is implemented using a structured state-space model and numerical root-finding.

### Problem 2 – Postseason Opponent Probability

**Objective**

Compute the probability that the Brewers face the Padres in the Divisional Series under specific postseason and tiebreaker rules.

**Given**

- Current standings
- Remaining regular season games modeled as 50/50 outcomes
- Tiebreaker rules based on existing standings
- Wild Card round structure
- Higher seed wins each playoff game with 55% probability

**Requirements**

- Simulate remaining regular-season outcomes
- Determine final seedings with tiebreak logic
- Simulate Wild Card series outcomes
- Estimate the probability of the Brewers facing the Padres

This is implemented using Monte Carlo simulation with repeatable probabilistic modeling.

### Problem 3 – Contract Break-Even Analysis

**Objective**

Determine the salary value \( X \) in the final two years of an 8-year guaranteed contract such that it is break-even relative to a year-to-year contract structure.

**Given**

- Projected WAR values (2026–2033)
- 20% annual probability of season-ending injury
- WAR penalty of −1.5 in the season following injury
- Two contract structures:
  - Year-to-year decision-based renewal
  - Fully guaranteed 8-year deal with unknown \( X \) in final two seasons

**Requirements**

- Model injury-adjusted expected WAR
- Compute expected value under both contract structures
- Use backward induction for decision-based renewal
- Solve for \( X \) such that expected values are equal

This is implemented using dynamic programming and expected value modeling.

## Methodology

Across all problems, the following principles were applied:

- Explicit modeling of assumptions
- Clear separation of states and transitions
- Reproducible probabilistic simulations
- Efficient computation using NumPy
- Numerical solution techniques where closed-form solutions are infeasible
