# Brewers Research & Development – Coding Solutions (2025–2026)
Probabilistic modeling, simulation, and expected value analysis for the Milwaukee Brewers R&amp;D Questionnaire (2025–2026).


## Overview

This repository contains my analytical and computational solutions to selected quantitative problems from the Milwaukee Brewers Research & Development Questionnaire (2025–2026).

The goal of these problems is to evaluate probabilistic reasoning, simulation design, decision modeling, and expected-value analysis within realistic baseball and operational contexts.

All solutions are implemented in Python using a combination of:

- State-space modeling
- Dynamic programming
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Expected value analysis
- Probability modeling
